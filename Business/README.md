# Preface
In short I've done 2 major things for the subject Business. One of them is starting an imaginary company with a classmate of mine. The other one is showing data in different types of graphs using R. Also above you see *original reports*, these are the reports I handed in to my teacher. They are in Dutch tho.

# TravelTV
For Business I had to work together in a group, with Nick Friendship, and start a company. The company could be anything we liked so we combined our interesses and came up with a device that plays music in your car. Sadly this already existed, so we changed it to a television in your car. But since this was too dangerous our final idea was software wherin you can stream television channels on your mobile or pc. 

## What did we do at school for our project
Since this wasn't my favourite subject I'll try to keep it really short. School made us make a Problem Analysis, Customer Analysis and a Product Analysis. Also did we make requirements for our product and ranked them with the MoSCoW method. At last the most important thing was, for everything we made we had to ask for feedback. This way we could keep improving our analysis/product. The entire document with all these exercises you can find back in the link below. Sadly it's in dutch and it's not really worth translating. Go check out cooler stuff I made.

# R Notebook
I had to turn raw data into usefull information. All students got raw data from school, but you were also allowed to use the fake data of your own imaginary company. Using the data of your comapny would give you a better grade so I chose to do that. In our fake data we had lots of values like age, gender, subscription and more. [Here's the data we used](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/School-Semester-Summaries/blob/master/Semester%201%20-%20Media/Business/Original%20Reports%20(Dutch)/DummyData%20(Werkmap.xlsx).xlsx).

Here's one of the graphs

The bottom line is very hard to read, but it says how people found the software. From the graph above you can conclude that people who downloaded the software by an poster-ad or a google-ad will most likely go for the free trial. for the rest its very even and spread out.

Here's another one

Again very hard to read the bottom, it's about how people found our software. Here we can conclude that people who have attended the TravelTV presentations are more likely to buy the lifetime service. That's probably because they have been informed better than the people who haven been infromed by a google ad. as you see (or not), people who haven been informed by google ads are more likely to go for free trials. At last we see that people who found the app through friedns/family are more likely to buy a montly subsciption.

One more

In this graph you can see how many times men and women switch device while watching. It's very even so you can't really conclude anything.

This is the last one

Here you can see which micro transactions people bought with which subsciption. People with a free trial didnt buy any extra's, since they can't in a free trial. In the lifetime service people dont buy *remove ads, playback and record*. That's because they already get those in the lifetime service. In the graph you can see that people don't buy more that 1 device wht a montly subscription.

# Company Advice
A part of the exercise was to give our imaginary company an advice based of the data analysis.

## Advice
With the monthly service, people are not so easily triggered to buy extras. I suggest that we limit the monthly service a little more. Taking out normal functions that are normally in there and making people pay for them. the other services are now on a
good position.

It is also important that we advertise more clearly. The presentation where we presented our product has motivated many people to buy the lifetime service. But with the other advertisements, it is mainly the monthly service that is purchased.
We can change that. We need to make the posters and ads on google clear and better convince people to go for the lifetime service.

The average age is around 35 which is not really a surprise. We should try to appeal to younger people with our software. Young people are mainly on youtube and netflix. I think it's a good idea to put movies and series on our software. So that in addition to watching live television, you can also watch movies and series.

We have noticed that we have a lot more male users. I don't know if it's possible, but maybe a discount for women. this way we can get more female users.

# Reflection/Evaluation
Here we'll briefly summarize my Business experience.

## What went good?

### Planning
In total we got 7 weeks for the company-project. Since there were 7 exercises, we decided to do one exercise a week. The first exercise was just reading an article so we made 2 exercises the first week giving us always +1 week extra. Everything went as we wished, but if it didn't, we always had that extra week we could do improvements.

### Teamwork
As if in teamwork, everything went pretty well. My project-mate was always in time in class just like me. And if we had questions after school, when we were at home,  we could also ask each other anything.

## What did I learn?
Few things, How to make a customer analysis, product analysis and engage processes. Also did Business introduce me to the MoSCoW method and RStudio. 

## Which skills do I want to develop?
First of all, getting better at RStudio. Nothing else really. RStudio was enjoyable at times but the graphs I made were so terrible. It was lots of trial and error. I can imagine it being more fun when I have a better understanding of whats going on.

## What am I proud of?
Not really proud of anything, the product idea we made up was pretty cool but that's it really.

## What will I do different next time?
### Be less dependent
So, usually Nick, my classmate, would deliver our work to the teacher digitally. He did this every week. One time he forgot to deliver it and I had never done it before, so that wasn't so nice. So next time I could try to be more involved in the delivering proces.

### Coding Language
I've coded everything in Dutch. I want to switch to English in the future so that if I show people the queries I did, its readable for everyone. 

### Graphs
The graphs are absolutely terrible, looks like someone made the graphs just to pass this subject, and as if they weren't interested in this subject at all ðŸ˜³. Next time I'd make the values at the bottom in English and try to make them readable, also would I try to make a usefull graph where you can take a good conclusion of.

# Epilogue
In the end, I'm 100% sure I'm not choosing Business. From everything I've done till now, the subject Business doesn't appeal to me.
