# Preface
A full schoolyear exists of 2 semesters. This means this was my first half year on IT. When I started this study I didn't have any coding experience. At the time I did have 1,5 years experience on [Dreams](https://indreams.me/). Dreams is an application on playstation wherin you can create games, music, animations, etcetera. Dreams uses an Drag-and-Drop-like way of coding. So I did have some experience with that.

# Subjects
This semester we had to follow 5 subjects. You follow all 5 subjects for 20 weeks. After the 20 weeks you put a focus on a single subject. This semester I decided to put a focus on the subject *Media*. This means that in the section *Group Projects* you will see more work related to the subject *Media*. Quick sidenote, I'm writing this 1,5 years after I actually finished the semester. Therefore smaller projects and/or exercises might be missing. Another even quicker sidenote, Per subject I have the original reports (in Dutch) that I also delivered to my teachers. The README's are bascially the original reports translated to English without irrelevant information.
