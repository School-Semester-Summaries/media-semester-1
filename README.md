# Preface
A full schoolyear exists of 2 semesters. This means this was my first half year on IT. When I started this study I didn't have any coding experience. At the time I did have 1,5 years experience on [Dreams](https://indreams.me/). Dreams is an application on playstation wherin you can create games, music, animations, etcetera. Dreams uses an Drag-and-Drop-like way of coding. So I did have some experience with that.

# Subjects
This semester we had to follow 5 subjects. You follow all 5 subjects for 20 weeks. After the 20 weeks you put a focus on a single subject. This semester I decided to put a focus on the subject *Media*. This means that in the section *Group Projects* you will see more work related to the subject *Media*. Quick sidenote, I'm writing this 1,5 years after I actually finished the semester. Therefore smaller projects and/or exercises might be missing. Another even quicker sidenote, Per subject I have the original reports (in Dutch) that I also delivered to my teachers. The README's are bascially the original reports translated to English without irrelevant information.

# Group Projects
The group projects, also referred to as "Proftaken", were projects wherein you had to combine all the 5 subjects taught in the first 20 weeks. The projects we made as a group are TimeCube and Pixoul.

## TimeCube
TimeCube is a cube which tracks how you spend your time across the day. Nowadays there are many projects which do the exact same thing. The document we delivered as a group can be read when clicked on this link -> [Click here to go to the TimeCube Document](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/media-semester-1/blob/master/Group%20Projects/TimeCube.pdf)

## Pixoul
Pixoul is a medieval pixel art game we built as a group. We couldn't work a lot on it so there isn't too much functionality in the game but it can be donwloaded and played. Here are the files ->
